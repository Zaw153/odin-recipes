    <img href="../home/zawgyi153/odin-recipes/recipes/images/air fryer chicken leg.webp" alt="Fried chicken leg"/>
    <p>To make these air fryer chicken legs—crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside—all you need is 5 ingredients and an air fryer. These chicken drumsticks are quick, easy, and seasoned just right.</p>
    <ul>Ingredients
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 skin-on chicken drumsticks</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>Directions
        <li>Step 1
            <p>Preheat an air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Combine garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a small bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>Place drumsticks on a clean work surface. Sprinkle spice mix evenly over all sides of the drumsticks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Place drumsticks in the basket of the air fryer and cook for 10 minutes. Using tongs, flip chicken over and cook for 10 minutes more. Rest for 5 minutes before serving. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
